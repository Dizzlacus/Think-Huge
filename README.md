# Think-Huge.github.io

Couple things I noticed during development 

Seems to be a spelling error on the desktop view of "cored" instead of cores. 
The hover effect on the button is different to that of the live site. I kept to the design but I thought it was worth noting, ended up just using the usual state as the hover state. 

In total development took 6 hours. 

Development breakdown
- 30mins environment set up - tweaking gulp file.js
- 4 hours developing (the fun bit)
- 1 hour reviewing
- 30mins hosting - first time hosting with Github pages 

I also developed down to a screen width of 375px which is iPhone 12/13 mini. Anything lower than that Greg starts to overlap. Thought about making Greg disappear lower than that but felt like a major design change,

Happy to make further revisions youâ€™re after.

Genuinely looking forward to your feedback.

Mikey,
